# Induction Heads
## Sources
You can find a partial reproduction of the Induction heads work (https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html) at the transformer lens github: https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens (https://colab.research.google.com/github/ckkissane/induction-heads-transformer-lens/blob/main/Induction_Heads_Phase_Change.ipynb).

## Overview
Broadly, the idea here is to see whether there are any patterns in which the model's weight changes (or gradients) change rapidly around the time that induction heads form.
